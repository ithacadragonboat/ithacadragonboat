**What is dragon boating?**<br>
Dragon boats were first developed in the Pearl River Delta in Southern China 2500 years ago. The dragon, one of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs, is the ruler of water on earth. The boat is decorated with a dragon head at the bow and a tail at the stern, and scales on the sides. A drummer keeps the paddlers in sync and sits at the bow of the boat, rhythmically pounding the symbolic “heart” of the dragon. In the 20-person boats people sit side by side on seats and move the boat through the water with their paddles, which symbolize the claws of the dragon. 

Dragon boat racing gained popularity in the 1970s due to the growing number of dragon boat teams around the world, but annual Dragon Boat Festivals have been around for more than 2000 years. The festivals, which take place in May or June were started to encourage rainfall, thus increasing crop yields. Dragon boating is now popular around the world, but it is rooted in Asian and Pacific Island cultures. The history and cultural significance of dragon boating is an important facet of experience.

**Do I need to know how to swim?**<br>
Yes. It is essential that you feel comfortable in the water and, although you don’t need to be a good swimmer, you should have some basic swim skills.

**Do I need to have paddling experience?**<br>
No! Come and we will introduce you to the basic paddling stroke. Many of our members utilize dragon boating as an introduction to other paddling sports like Stand up Paddleboard, outrigger canoe and others.

**What’s the age limit?**<br>
The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club welcomes anyone that is interested in learning about the sport and getting onto the water with a group of diverse members from different age groups, professions, racial and ethnic backgrounds. The youngest person that can participate is 12 years old.

**Do I have to be a member of the club in order to participate?**<br>
We are excited to have everyone try out dragon boating before they commit to becoming a member. Beginners are welcome to attend two practices. Afterwards, we are sure that you will love it as much as we do and will want to become a member.

**How do I become a member?**<br>
The fee for membership is $300 for the season which usually begins in May and continues through the fall, weather permitting. A membership form and waiver need to be filled out and signed. Checks are payable to the Ithaca Dragon Boat Club and can be mailed to:<br>
Ithaca Dragon Boat Club<br>
P.O. Box 4016<br>
Ithaca, NY 14851<br>
Alternatively, you can bring the check to practice and hand it to our membership dues coordinator.

**Can I pay the membership fee in installments?**<br>
Yes, paying the fee in installments is an option and must be arranged with the membership dues coordinator.

**What does the membership fees go towards?**<br>
Fees help to defray the cost of equipment, maintenance, storage, dock rentals, insurance liabilities and various programs related to our stated objectives, such as our open house.

**When are practices?**<br>
Our practices are scheduled three days a week: Mondays & Wednesdays (6-7:30 pm) and Saturdays (9-10:30 am). We meet at the boat docks across from the playground and located behind the Cass Park Rink and Pool. We suggest that you arrive at least 15 minutes early. You’ll need time to pick up your gear from the shed, stretch and climb into the boat.

**What should I wear?**<br>
If the weather is chilly, dressing in layers is the best choice. Your hands and lower arms will get wet. Bring paddling or biking gloves if you have them. Wear articles of clothing that you don't mind getting wet. Choose synthetics over cotton. Wear something you would typically work out in. We wear sneakers if the temperatures are still cool. Flip flops, sandals and water shoes are good when the weather heats up.

**Do I need to buy a paddle? What about a life vest?**<br>
No to both. Paddles and PFDs are available in our club shed. Many people who have been paddling for a while choose to buy their own equipment but this is not required.

**What about the races?**<br>
The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club registers teams to compete in several races throughout the summer. You MUST be a member of the Club in order to be eligible to race. Members are not required to participate in races. They are voluntary and involve additional fees.

**What else does the Club participate in?**<br>
Open House<br>
Each year our team hosts an open house in conjunction with other groups offering paddle sports, such as the Cayuga Outrigger Club, SUP (stand up paddleboard) Cayuga and others. This event is open to the public and offers community members an opportunity to try out all the different water sports that Ithaca has to offer.

Social Events<br>
Our team gets together for informal social events throughout the year. We have barbecues, potlucks, celebrations and other gatherings.

Community Service<br>
The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club has adopted a portion of the Cayuga Waterfront Trail. We weed, brush cut, clear litter and generally maintain the trail. We also support the events of other organizations in the area such as Plastic Tides, Friends of Stewart Park and Glorious Trash Birds. We’ve participated as a team in the Cancer Resource Center Walkathon.
