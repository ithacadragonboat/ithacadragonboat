Founded in 2004, The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to building a vibrant community through the culture and sport of dragon boating on our beautiful Cayuga Lake. We are a fun and friendly team of all ages that enjoy paddling. Whether you're looking to be part of a competitive team or just want to have fun on the water, there is a place for you and your friends. We meet three times a week at the Cass Park docks in Ithaca, NY for [practice](/practices/). Our competitive racing team, the Ithaca Gorges Dragons, participates in 3-4 events in the Eastern Region throughout the season.
