Founded in 2004, The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to building a vibrant community through the culture and sport of dragon boating on our beautiful Cayuga Lake. We are a fun and friendly team of all ages that enjoy paddling. Whether you're looking to be part of a competitive team or just want to have fun on the water, there is a place for you and your friends. We meet three times a week at the Cass Park docks in Ithaca, NY for [practice](/practices/). Our competitive racing team, the Ithaca Gorges Dragons, participates in 3-4 events in the Eastern Region throughout the season. 

Ithaca Lake Effect Dragons (LED) is a women’s competitive team formed at their first race in 2023. LED is a group of women of all ages taking paddling to the next level working together as one. The team was named Lake Effect to represent Ithaca’s Cayuga Lake, our regular practice location and the impressive and powerful natural phenomena that regularly occurs there (lake effect snow and women’s paddling!)
